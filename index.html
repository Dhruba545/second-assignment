        <div class="extra1"><div class="extrat">Maldives</div> <div class="extrap">The Maldives, an enchanting tropical paradise in the Indian Ocean, is an archipelago comprising 26 atolls and over 1,000 coral islands. In 2004, the nation gained global attention due to the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami, which severely affected the Maldives, highlighting its vulnerability to climate change and rising sea levels. With its capital city, Mal√©, serving as the political and economic hub, the Maldives is known for its turquoise waters, pristine white-sand beaches, and vibrant coral reefs. Tourism, particularly in luxury resorts, plays a pivotal role in the Maldivian economy, attracting visitors with its idyllic overwater bungalows and diverse marine life.

            The Maldives has a rich cultural heritage influenced by Indian, Arab, and African traditions, evident in its language, cuisine, and traditional music and dance. The official religion is Islam, and the Maldivian people have a deep-rooted connection to their maritime heritage.
            
            As a low-lying nation, the Maldives faces ongoing challenges from climate change, leading to efforts in environmental conservation and sustainable tourism. In recent years, the Maldives has actively participated in international forums advocating for climate action and resilience in vulnerable island nations.

The territory is currently administered by three countries: India, Pakistan, and China. The long-standing Kashmir conflict has been a source of tension between India and Pakistan, both claiming the region in its entirety.

The revocation of its special autonomy in 2019 stirred controversy and escalated tensions. The region is predominantly Muslim, and the demographic and political changes have been contentious.
